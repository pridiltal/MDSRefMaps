Description: Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) methods aim to represent similarities between high-dimensional objects in a low dimensional space, generally in two or three dimensions for visualization purpose. MDS representations are especially useful to explore and interpret high-dimensional biological data. However, comparisons between the different MDS representations can be difficult because of the absence of a common structure. The MDSRefMaps algorithm allows the projection of additional high-dimensional objects over a predefined MDS representation. The predefined representations are named MDS Reference Maps and the overlaid representations are named MDS Projections. The MDSRefMaps algorithm is based on a molecular dynamics approach and has been implemented in C++ to handle large amount of objects. Moreover, the MDSRefMaps algorithm can handle both Euclidean and Manhattan distances and can also handle incomplete distance matrices (matrices with missing values).
